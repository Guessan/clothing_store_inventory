# WEAR US
This is our Fall 2018 Python group project.

### Overview:
Our project consists of a database of clothing items. Each of our members is responsible for a particular item (shirt, jacket, jean, etc...). Each item comes with subcategories (price, color, size, gender, etc...). Images may be added later on.

### User Interaction:
* We'd like for the user to be able to:
  * Choose items, and have them be placed in a cart.
  * Choose items to organize into an outfit.
  * Have a random outfit be generated and then have the ability to add them to the cart.
